# Information Assessment 

This repository contains tools and resources for assessing the information available in a dataset and the prior knowledge that can be used to create hybrid models for the chemical process industry.

## Introduction

Hybrid models, which combine multiple modeling approaches, have the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions in the chemical process industry. However, the success of these models depends on the quality and quantity of data and prior knowledge that is available.

This repository aims to provide a framework for assessing the information available in a dataset and the prior knowledge that can be used to create hybrid models. It includes tools for:
- Identifying the types of data that are available
- Evaluating the quality and quantity of the data
- Assessing the relevance and reliability of prior knowledge
